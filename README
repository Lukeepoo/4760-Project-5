# CS 4760 Assignment 5: Resource Management

## Overview
This project simulates resource management in an operating system. It detects and resolves deadlocks using a deadlock detection and recovery strategy.

## Files
- `Makefile`: Builds the project.
- `oss.c`: Main simulator program.
- `user_proc.c`: Simulated user process.
- `resource.c` and `resource.h`: Resource management module.
- `common.c` and `common.h`: Shared utility functions.

## Build Instructions
Run `make` to build the project.

## Run Instructions
- Start the simulator: `./oss [-h] [-n proc] [-s simul] [-i intervalInMsToLaunchChildren] [-f logfile]`
- Terminate gracefully by sending `SIGINT`.

## Deadlock Policy
Processes are terminated in FIFO order to resolve deadlocks.

## Output
Logs are written to both the screen and a file specified by the `-f` option.
